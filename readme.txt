1.	Once you have our project installed, go into NetBeans.
2.	Click on file in the toolbar > import project > from zip.
3.	Select the zip file you downloaded.
4.	(optional) select a folder you’d like to export the project to.
5.	After importing the project, open up HeidiSQL.
6.	Log into your session manager. (if your username and password are different from “root” and “password” make sure to update this in the NetBeans project’s context.xml)
7.	Click on file in the toolbar > run SQL file. 
8.	Select the sql file included with our project.

After completing these steps, you should be able to run the project. If the page loads, then you have imported the project properly. If there are GIFs underneath the search bar, then you have your database set up as well.
